        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>

        <p><b>I'm currently studying at Central Foundation Boys' School as part of their sixth form cohort. I'm
                currently enrolled in the Vocational IT and Digital Media Course. From an early age, I've been
                fascinated by digital media's ability to inform, inspire, and connect people. My studies in the C-Tech
                IT & Digital Media course have deepened my passion, equipping me with technical and creative skills to
                thrive in the field. Through coursework and projects, I've built a solid foundation in digital media,
                focusing on storytelling, design, and project management.
                A key project during my GCSEs involved designing a home-office solution, which taught me how digital
                tools can improve daily life. Balancing this with other subjects enhanced my time management and
                problem-solving abilities, skills I apply in my Digital Media coursework. I strive to deliver both
                precise and creative work, always aiming to exceed expectations.</b></p>
